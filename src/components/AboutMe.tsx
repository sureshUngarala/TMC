        <span>My journey</span>
        <div>
          Growing up in Andhra Pradesh, India, in close proximity to nature, I
          developed an interest in photography and nature. Over time, I started
          getting passionate about photography, travelling and exploring nature.
          So, I pursued my passion for photography over societal trends and
          earned a PG in Photography from NICC situated in Bangalore, India. I
          would like to mention that I submitted a book in my final semester of
          PG, Southern Fairy Tales of India-a magazine which was accepted. I was
          fortunate to get mentorship from a veteran mentor, Dr. Akash Rose, a
          specialist photographer across multiple streams, director of NICC and
          brand ambassador for Canon, India. He is a very well-known person with
          dignity in the field of photography. I got the chance to work at
          Wander Trails instantly after completing my graduation from a
          first-tier university through direct placement. Thus, I finally
          introduced myself to real-world photography services!
